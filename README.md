## HTML5

   * For start i create basic structrure in Index.html file , for `<title>` put the name of the restaurant I do the website for "Pizza Amphora".

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>
			Pizza Amphora
		</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		Menu	
	</body>
</html>
```

   *  At the begining of page i created `<a>` element for logo and `<header>` with 3 differetn `<li>` (index.html,gallery.html and contact.html). One for each subpages. Then I created 3 different `<section>` and `<footer>` element. 

   * The first section contains "hero-images" wich is first photo on the page. Next thing what i crete was one more section, wich one will be section About Us and text whitc will be interesting text about restornat. Next section have few `<div>` element, 
      each for every pat of page. (About Us,Menu and Special Offer.)

   * Next thing what i crete was one more section, with 6 `<div>` element. Each of that element have has a built structure with `<h2>`, `<hr>`, `<p>`, `<ul>` and `<li>` elememt , as we can see. 
         
        ```<div>
                   <h2></h2>
                   <hr>
                   <p>
                       <ul>
                           <li></li>
                           <li></li>
                           <li></li>
                           <li></li>
                       </ul>
                   </p>
               </div>```

   * Next think was one more `<section>` for Special Offer part of Web page , wagain with few more `<div>` element. Each of that `<div>` have `<h2>` and `<h2>`. 
   
       ```<div>
                <h2></h2>
                <h3></h3>
                <h3></h3>
                <h3></h3>
            </div>```
